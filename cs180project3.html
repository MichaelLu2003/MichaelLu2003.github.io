    <h1>Maochuan Lu - CS180 Project 3</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        In this project, I did a manual correspondance between images, created a morph and warp of my face into another person's face, computed the average face of a population, 
and generate a caricature of myself by extrapolating from the population mean. Besides, I also use those techniques to somehow change the gender of my own face.

    <h4>Part 1</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 32px;">
        First, I first label the corresponding points using the correspondance tool provided by last year's student. 
        Secondly, I loaded facial keypoints from json file created by that tool, 
        Thirdly, I computed the midpoint of corresponding keypoints between the two faces. 
        Then, I use Delaunay triangulation on that midpoint. Also I visualized that triangulation on both images.
        Here is sthe result:

    <h4>Part 2</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 32px;">
        I first cropped my face and my friend Nancy's face to have the same dimenstion and use the key points giving by corresponding tool, I computed an average face shape using the midpoints of corresponding keypoints from both faces. 
        Then, I use Delaunay triangulation, and calculated affine transformations for each triangle in the images and warped them to the average shape. 
        Finally, I did a cross-dissolve to blend two faces to get a midway face. 
        Here is the result:

    <h4>Part 3</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 32px;">
        In Part 2, I created a GIF morph sequence with 45 frames, each with a duration of 30 ms. Since the GIF file was too large to upload to GitHub, I converted it into a YouTube video. You can watch it directly below:
