    <h1>Maochuan Lu - CS180 Project 4A</h1>

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Part A: Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
       In this project, I first shoot multiple photographs for California Hall, Valley Life Science Buidling, my living room, etc and align them using homographies, 
      then I inverse warp the images using that homography matrix, and blend them into a mosaic.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Part A: Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
       In this project, I first shoot multiple photographs for California Hall, Valley Life Science Building, my living room, and more. Then, I align them using homographies, 
      inverse warp the images using the homography matrix, and blend them into a mosaic.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Shoot the Pictures</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Here are all the pictures I used for this project:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
        <li>This is a picture from NYC Metropolitan Museum of Art:
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/painting.jpg" width="800" alt="NYC Metropolitan Museum painting"></li>
        
        <li>This is a poster I shot in Taiwan during the election:
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/poster.jpg" width="800" alt="Election poster in Taiwan"></li>
        
        <li>This is a random picture I shot in Main Stack:
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/library.jpg" width="800" alt="Main Stack library"></li>
        
        <li>California Hall:
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/calhall1.jpg" width="800" alt="California Hall photo 1">
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/calhall2.jpg" width="800" alt="California Hall photo 2">
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/calhall3.jpg" width="800" alt="California Hall photo 3"></li>
        
        <li>Valley Life Science Building:
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/vlsb1.jpg" width="800" alt="Valley Life Science Building photo 1">
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/vlsb2.jpg" width="800" alt="Valley Life Science Building photo 2">
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/vlsb3.jpg" width="800" alt="Valley Life Science Building photo 3"></li>
        
        <li>My living room:
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/lv1.jpg" width="800" alt="Living room photo 1">
        <br><img src="./proj4a_pic/lv2.jpg" width="800" alt="Living room photo 2">

    </ul>
    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Part 2</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        I first cropped my face and my friend Nancy's face to have the same dimenstion and use the key points giving by corresponding tool, I computed an average face shape using the midpoints of corresponding keypoints from both faces. 
        Then, I use Delaunay triangulation, and calculated affine transformations for each triangle in the images and warped them to the average shape. 
        Finally, I did a cross-dissolve to blend two faces to get a midway face. 
        Here is the result:

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Part 3</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        In Part 2, I created a GIF morph sequence with 45 frames, each with a duration of 30 ms. Since the GIF file was too large to upload to GitHub, I converted it into a YouTube video. You can watch it directly below:

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Part 4</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        I used the Danes dataset. I first get keypoints from .asf files for male and female images by parsing files.
        Then after i do this, I firgure out that my final image only has face without background and clothes.
        So I added extra points, specifically, I added points in the corners and boundaries.
        Then I computed the average face shape for all, male, and female keypoints separately. 
        In detail, for each image, I used Delaunay triangulation to warp the face into the average shape by applying affine transformations to each triangle. 
        Here is four examples: 
    </p>
    <img src="./proj3_pic/Part4.1.png" width="800" alt="Part4.1.png"> <br/>
    <img src="./proj3_pic/Part4.2.png" width="800" alt="Part4.2.png"> <br/>
    <img src="./proj3_pic/Part4.3.png" width="800" alt="Part4.3.png"> <br/>
    <img src="./proj3_pic/Part4.4.png" width="800" alt="Part4.4.png"> <br/>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">
    I computed the average female, male, and Danes faces by warping each image to its average shape, averaging pixel values.
    Here is the result
    </p>
    <img src="./proj3_pic/Part4.5.png" width="1100" alt="Part4.5.png"> <br/>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
    Then, I loaded keypoints for me  and the average Dane face from a JSON file and warped both faces. I warped my face to the average Dane and also warped the 
    average Dane face to match my face. Here is the result.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Part 5</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
    I extrapolated my keypoints from the average Dane face by calculating the difference between them with alpha. I applied two different alphas (1.5 and -0.5) to exaggerate. 
        Here is the results using exaggerating points to warp my face to average Dane face.

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Bells and Whistles: Gender Change</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
    I want to change my face (male) to female. And I did following things:
    <u style="font-size: 20px;"l>
        <li><strong>Appearance only:</strong> Only the appearance of myself was morphed into the average Chinese female face.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape only:</strong> The shape was morphed halfway between me and the average female face.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape and Appearance:</strong> Both shape and appearance were blended between the two faces.</li>
    </ul>
