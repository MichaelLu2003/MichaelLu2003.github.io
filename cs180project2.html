    <h1>Maochuan Lu - CS180 Project 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        In this project, we use custom filters to perform various tasks, such as blending images and sharpening images. Itâ€™s really interesting! Below is the documentation and ideas behind my code:
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: larger;">Part 1</h3>

    <h4>Part 1.1</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        First, I computed the partial derivatives in both the x and y directions using convolution with finite difference operators, where D<sub>x</sub> = [1, -1] and D<sub>y</sub> = [1, -1]<sup>T</sup>. 
        Then, I calculated the gradient magnitude from these derivatives and binarized the result based on a threshold of 0.3. Here are the resulting images:

    <h4>Part 1.2</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        I created a 2D Gaussian kernel using a 1D Gaussian, then applied it to the input image via convolution. Afterward, I computed the partial derivatives in the x and y directions on the blurred image. 
        I then computed the gradient magnitude and binarized the result using a threshold to display the results.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        One thing I noticed is that the result using this technique has clearer and thicker edges. Additionally, the image has less noise, as small and irrelevant details are filtered out.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Next, I computed the derivatives of the Gaussian kernel in both the x and y directions, then convolved the image with these kernels to obtain the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) gradients. Afterward, I calculated the gradient magnitude and binarized it based on a threshold of 0.1. 
        Here are the results.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Compared to the previous image, we can see that the results are essentially the same, as they are computed either in two separate steps or in one combined operation.

<ol style="font-size: 16px;">
    <li>To align channels, we definitely need to move or shift a channel based on xy-displacement.
    In this case, we create a helper function <code>shift(pic, x, y)</code> using <code>np.roll</code>.</li>
    
    <li>We also need a metric to evaluate whether this shift can give us better alignment. I chose normalized cross-correlation for this metric, which is more robust to brightness.</li>
    
    <li>With <code>ncc</code> and <code>shift</code>, we begin to implement our naive align function, which simply compares each possible shift in a window and returns the best shift with the best <code>ncc</code> score.</li>
    
    <li>However, with the naive alignment function, processing large pictures is quite slow. So we implemented a pyramid alignment function using recursion (an iterative one is quite slow). 
        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, we get our base case (level == 0) and simply return naive alignment at the final layer.</li>
            <li>Secondly, for other levels, we scale down pictures by a factor of 2, creating a pyramid of images at lower resolutions. Then it recursively calls <code>pyramid_align</code> on images at the next level.</li>
            <li>After finding the best alignment at a lower resolution, we scale the current best alignment offsets by a factor of 2, since the previous level was downscaled by a factor of 2.</li>
            <li>Then we shift <code>pic1</code> based on these scaled offsets and refine the alignment by performing a final alignment at the current level using the <code>align</code> function.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>When finishing implementing the above function, our alignment for simple pictures like <code>cathedral.jpg</code> looks great, but for images like <code>emir.tif</code>, it does not align well.</li>
    
    <li>After I checked the ed, a classmate suggested that using <code>feature.canny</code> and cropping would be helpful, so I began to research what <code>canny</code> is and how to use it through Google.</li>
    
    <li>I then implemented the <code>manual_crop</code> function, which simply scales down the height and width by a fixed percentage (e.g., 15%) to remove borders.</li>
    
    <li>Finally, I used the skeleton code to align channels processed by <code>canny</code> and got their shifted coordinates. Then I applied these coordinates back to the original image and shifted them to get a full image.</li>
    
    <li>It works really well for all of the images!</li>
