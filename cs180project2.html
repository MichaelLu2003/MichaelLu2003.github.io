    <h1>Maochuan Lu - CS180 Project 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        In this project, we use custom filters to perform various tasks, such as blending images and sharpening images. Itâ€™s really interesting! Below is the documentation and ideas behind my code:

    <h3 style="font-size: larger;">Part 1</h3>

    <h4>Part 1.1</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        First, I computed the partial derivatives in both the x and y directions using convolution with finite difference operators, where D<sub>x</sub> = [1, -1] and D<sub>y</sub> = [1, -1]<sup>T</sup>. 
        Then, I calculated the gradient magnitude from these derivatives and binarized the result based on a threshold of 0.3. Here are the resulting images:

    <h4>Part 1.2</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        I created a 2D Gaussian kernel using a 1D Gaussian, then applied it to the input image via convolution. Afterward, I computed the partial derivatives in the x and y directions on the blurred image. 
        I then computed the gradient magnitude and binarized the result using a threshold to display the results.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        One thing I noticed is that the result using this technique has clearer and thicker edges. Additionally, the image has less noise, as small and irrelevant details are filtered out.

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Next, I computed the derivatives of the Gaussian kernel in both the x and y directions, then convolved the image with these kernels to obtain the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) gradients. Afterward, I calculated the gradient magnitude and binarized it based on a threshold of 0.1. 
        Here are the results.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Compared to the previous image, we can see that the results are essentially the same, as they are computed either in two separate steps or in one combined operation.
